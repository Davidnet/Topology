\section*{Compactness and Connectedness}

\textbf{Definition} A subset $K$ if a topological space $X$ is \textit{compact} if every open cover of $K$  has a finite subcover. A subset is compact if and only if it is compact as a topological space whit it is given its relative topologt, that is, if and only if every cover by relatively open sets has a finite subcover. 

\textbf{Proposition} Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $ K \subseteq X $.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $K$ is a compact subset of $X$, then $K$ is closed.
	\item If $K$ is compact and $F$ is a closed set contained in $K$, then $F$ is compact.
	\item The continuous image of a compact set is compact.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Corollary } IF $X$ is a compact space and $ f:X \rightarrow \RR $ is a continuous function, then there are points $a$ and $b$ in $X$ such that $ f(a) \leq f(x) \leq f(b) $ for all $x$ in $X$.

\textbf{Proposition} If $ K $ is a closed subset of a topological space $X$, then $K$ is compact if and only if every collection of closed subsets of $K$  having the FIP has a nonempty intersection.
